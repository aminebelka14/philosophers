TODO :

	- Timestamp functions returning elsaped time since call

	- Individual philosophers structure

	- Main thread looping death check

	- Custom sleep function (looping usleep for 10ms)

	- Offsetting thread start on odd or even philos (avoiding akward forks dispotition)

	- Mutexes on variables :
		- Time check
		- Death
		- Forks
		- Timestamp print


Try to deduce if each philo will survive the next step then custom sleep
for the calculated time of death, lock display mutex and return

NOTES :


During death loop, check the value of must eat for each philo
And if the value is reached stop all thread

All mutexes should be unlocked when quitting

Exit sequence :
Unlock all mutexes
Join all thread
Destroy and free all
